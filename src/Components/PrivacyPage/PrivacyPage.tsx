                services that may be of interest to you, we may use the “personal information” i.e. information that could be
                used to contact you directly (without using the <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform) such as full name, postal address,
                phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or “demographic information” (i.e. information
                that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, pin
                code, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration
                history information. You represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide us with any such contact
                information. Demographic information is divided into two categories:
                <li>“non-public information”, which consists of ride transaction information and one-on-one
                  communications between you and other users of the <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform</li>
                <li>“public information”, which consists of all other demographic information</li>
              </p>
              <h6>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </h6>
              <p style={{color:'grey'}}>
                We use your email address, phone number and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate the
                <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the
                <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could
                affect your relationship with <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b>).These types of communications are known as “Operational
                Communications.”<br />
                <br />
                In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and
                special offers. To operate the <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform, including processing your transactions and supporting
                your activities on the <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform, we may share your personal information with our agents,
                representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as email
                origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfillment. We
                require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.

              </p>
              <h6>HOW WE USE THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA </h6>

                Platform and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on
                an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we
                may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to you as a user of the
                <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Platform.<br />
                <br />
                Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which
                particular <b style={{color:'black'}}>Excellent Softwares</b> Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy
                policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted
                to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may
                be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group.
              </p>
